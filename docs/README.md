## __Terminus Code Calculator__

__*Scope and Functionality*__ - This simple program is meant to calculate the answers to the equations found in the Black Ops 6 Zombies map, Terminus.

The user will be asked for 3 separate inputs:
1. The value of variable "x"
2. The value of variable "y"
3. The value of variable "z"

The program will then calculate the answer to the appropriate equation and output the answers.
